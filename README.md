<h1>Keyboard Layout Trainer</h1>

<h3>Background & Overview</h3>
<p> 
The traditional QWERTY layout was designed for typewriters to minimize jams
by spreading the most commmonly used keys across the keyboard. There have been more ergonomic 
and efficient layout designed for a more accurate and comfortable typing experience.
While switching to a different keyboard is difficult, the benefits are great and better tools should make the transition more smooth.
This should provide typing practice for people trying to switch to a different keyboard layout.
